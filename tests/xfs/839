# FS QA Test No. 839
#
# Regression test for kernel commits:
#
# 5679897eb104 ("vfs: make sync_filesystem return errors from ->sync_fs")
# 2d86293c7075 ("xfs: return errors in xfs_fs_sync_fs")
#
# During a code inspection, I noticed that sync_filesystem ignores the return
# value of the ->sync_fs calls that it makes.  sync_filesystem, in turn is used
# by the syncfs(2) syscall to persist filesystem changes to disk.  This means
# that syncfs(2) does not capture internal filesystem errors that are neither
# visible from the block device (e.g. media error) nor recorded in s_wb_err.
# XFS historically returned 0 from ->sync_fs even if there were log failures,
# so that had to be corrected as well.
#
# The kernel commits above fix this problem, so this test tries to trigger the
# bug by using the shutdown ioctl on a clean, freshly mounted filesystem in the
# hope that the EIO generated as a result of the filesystem being shut down is
# only visible via ->sync_fs.
