# Beginning with 5.18, some filesystems support creating large folios for the
# page cache.  A system with 64k pages can create 256k folios, which means
# that with the old file size of 1M, the last half of the file is completely
# converted from unwritten to written by page_mkwrite.  The test will fail on
# the golden output when this happens, so increase the size from the original
# 1MB file size to at least (6 * 256k == 1.5MB) prevent this from happening.
#
# However, increasing the file size to around 2MB causes regressions when fsdax
# is enabled because fsdax will try to use PMD entries for the mappings.  Hence
# we need to set the file size to (6 * 2MB == 12MB) to cover all cases.
