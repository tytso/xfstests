# FS QA Test No. 079
#
# Regression test for a bug in the log record checksum mechanism of XFS. Log
# records are checksummed during recovery and a warning or mount failure occurs
# on checksum verification failure. XFS had a bug where the checksum mechanism
# verified different parts of a record depending on the current log buffer size.
# This caused spurious checksum failures when a filesystem is recovered using a
# different log buffer size from when the filesystem crashed.
#
# Test that log recovery succeeds with a different log buffer size from when the
# filesystem crashed.
