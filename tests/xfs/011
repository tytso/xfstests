# have space for at least one minimum sized log write between ailp->ail_head_lsn
# and log->l_tail_lsn, and that is what is showing up in the grant head
# reservation values.  We don't need to explicitly reserve it for the first
# iclog write after mount, but we always end up with it being present after the
# first checkpoint commits and the AIL returns the checkpoint's unused space
# back to the grant head.
#
# Hence just check the value is between 0 and the maximum iclog size (256kB).
