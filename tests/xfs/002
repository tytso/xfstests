# Test that garbage in old v4 superblocks doesn't trip verifiers during growfs
#
# Older kernels sometimes left garbage in the unused portions
# of the superblock during growfs; with the new verifiers this initially
# caused failures during a subsequent growfs; see
# 10e6e65 xfs: be more forgiving of a v4 secondary sb w/ junk in v5 fields
# for further explanation.  (NB: while the commit log was good, the
# patch had a bug which was subsequently fixed)
