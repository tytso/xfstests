# FS QA Test 445
#
# Test the XFS filestreams allocator for use-after-free inode access. The
# filestreams allocator uses the MRU and historically kept around unreferenced
# inode pointers in each element. These pointers could outlive the inodes they
# referred to and thus lead to access of freed or reused memory when the MRU
# element was reaped. Test for this problem by performing filestream allocations
# against short-lived parent directory inodes.
#
# Note that some form of kernel debug mechanism for use-after-free detection
# (i.e., KASAN) is required for this test to reproduce the original problem.
# This is because XFS uses a kmem cache for xfs_inode objects which means that
# the backing pages for freed inodes may still reside in the cache with the
# freed inodes in a partially initialized state.
