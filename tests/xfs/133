# FSQA Test No. 133
#
# Since loff_t is a signed type, it is invalid for a filesystem to load
# an inode with i_size = -1ULL.  Unfortunately, nobody checks this,
# which means that we can trivially DoS the VFS by creating such a file
# and appending to it.  This causes an integer overflow in the routines
# underlying writeback, which results in the kernel locking up.
#
# So, create this malformed inode and try a buffered append to make
# sure we catch this situation.
