# FS QA Test No. 306
#
# Regression test for an XFS multi-block buffer logging bug.
#
# The XFS bug results in a panic when a non-contiguous multi-block buffer is
# mapped and logged in a particular manner, such that only regions beyond the
# first fsb-sized mapping are logged. The crash occurs asynchronous to
# transaction submission, when the associated buffer log item is pushed from the
# CIL (i.e., when the log is subsequently flushed).
