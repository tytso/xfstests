# This test tries to get close to the exact point at which the filestreams
# allocator will start to allocate space from some AG into more than one
# stream.  Newer feature sets (e.g. reflink) have increased the size of the log
# for small filesystems, so we make sure there's one more AG than filestreams
# to encourage the allocator to skip whichever AG owns the log.
#
# This test exercises 64x 16MB AGs, 8 filestreams, 100 files per stream, and
# 1MB per file.
