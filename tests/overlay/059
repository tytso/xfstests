# FS QA Test 059
#
# Test multiple origin references to the same lower file.
#
# Multiple origin references to the same lower file from upper files that
# are not hardlinks will falsely return the same st_ino/st_dev for two
# different overlay files and will cause 'diff' to falsely report that
# content of files is the same when it is not.
#
# This test checks that overlayfs detects and fails lookup of a multiply
# referenced origin.
#
# The check for multiply referenced origin was a by-product of kernel
# commit 31747eda41ef ("ovl: hash directory inodes for fsnotify")
