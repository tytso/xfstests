# Test creating lower hardlinks for copied up files.
#
# kernel v4.13 introduced the index=on feature for not breaking hardlinks
# on copy-up.  With the index feature enabled a regression was introduced -
# lower files that are hardlined while overlay is offline can result in
# lookup error after overlay in mounted.
#
# The regression was fixed by upstream commit
#   6eaf011144af ovl: fix EIO from lookup of non-indexed upper
# that was merged to v4.14-rc7.
#
# This test verifies that behavior is sane after creating lower hardlinks
# for copied up files while overlayfs is offline.
