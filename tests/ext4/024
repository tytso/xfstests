# Create an encrypted file whose size is not a multiple of the filesystem block
# size, then add it to the orphan list.
#
# We create the encrypted file normally, rather than use debugfs to force the
# inode flags to ENCRYPT|EXTENTS as done in the example listed in the commit
# message of the kernel fix, because forcing the inode flags is incompatible
# with some MKFS_OPTIONS such as inline_data or ^extents.
#
# This choice does, however, have the disadvantage that this test won't detect
# the bug in as many situations, such as in kernels configured without
# encryption support.
