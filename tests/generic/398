# Filesystem encryption is designed to enforce that a consistent encryption
# policy is used within a given encrypted directory tree and that an encrypted
# directory tree does not contain any unencrypted files.  This test verifies
# that filesystem operations that would violate this constraint fail.  This does
# not test enforcement of this constraint on lookup, which is still needed to
# detect offline changes.
