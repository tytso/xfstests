# FS QA Test No. 057
#
# This test is motivated by an fsync issue discovered in btrfs.
# The issue was that we could lose file data, that was previously fsync'ed
# successfully, if we end up adding a hard link to our inode and then persist
# the fsync log later via an fsync of other inode for example.
#
# The btrfs issue was fixed by the following linux kernel patch:
#
#  Btrfs: fix fsync data loss after adding hard link to inode

# Add one hard link to our file. This made btrfs write into the in memory fsync
# log a special inode with generation 0 and an i_size of 0 too. Note that this
# didn't update the inode in the fsync log on disk.

_flakey_drop_and_remount

# After mounting the fs again, the fsync log was replayed.
# The btrfs fsync log replay code didn't update the i_size of the persisted
# inode because the inode item in the log had a special generation with a
# value of 0 (and it couldn't know the correct i_size, since that inode item
# had a 0 i_size too). This made the last 4Kb of file data inaccessible and
# effectively lost.
