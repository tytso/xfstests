# FS QA Test No. 518

# Test that we can not clone a range from a file A into the middle of a file B
# when the range includes the last block of file A and file A's size is not
# aligned with the filesystem's block size. Allowing such case would lead to
# data corruption since the data between EOF and the end of its block is
# undefined.
