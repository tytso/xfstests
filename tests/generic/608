# FS QA Test 608
# Toggling FS_XFLAG_DAX on an existing file can make S_DAX on the
# file change immediately when all applications close the file.
# It's a regression test for:
# 'commit 77573fa310d9 ("fs: Kill DCACHE_DONTCACHE dentry even if DCACHE_REFERENCED is set")'
#
# Write data into a file and then enable DAX on the file immediately,
# the written data which is still in the buffer should be synchronized
# to disk instead of discarded when the corresponding inode is evicted.
# It's a regression test for:
# 'commit 88149082bb8e ("fs: Handle I_DONTCACHE in iput_final() instead of generic_drop_inode()"'
