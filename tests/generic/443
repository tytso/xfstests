# This program use several vectors for writev(), the kernel goes over them
# one at a time, copying them from userspace, getting the user data ready
# for IO. If it takes a page fault while iterating over the vectors in the
# IOV, it stops, and sends what it got so far. We try to find a bug at this
# moment.
