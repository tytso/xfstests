# Test if btrfs rename handle dir item collision correctly
# Without patch fix, rename will fail with EOVERFLOW, and filesystem
# is forced readonly.

# This bug is going to be fixed by a patch for kernel titled
# "btrfs: correctly calculate item size used when item key collision happens"

# Currently in btrfs the node/leaf size can not be smaller than the page
# size (but it can be greater than the page size). So use the largest
# supported node/leaf size (64Kb) so that the test can run on any platform
