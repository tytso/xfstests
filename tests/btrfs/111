# Call sync to flush all delalloc data that the receiver processes created.
# Although 'btrfs receive' at the end calls a btrfs specific ioctl to change
# the snapshot from RW mode to RO mode, which commits the current btrfs
# transaction, the dealalloc data is not flushed, as the transaction commit
# intentionally does not do it unless the fs is mounted with '-o flushoncommit'.
# This is a detail that should probably be addressed either in the btrfs ioctls
# called by 'btrfs receive' or in the tools - our test has a different purpose,
# so we get around this by calling 'sync' to make sure all delalloc data is
# durably persisted and the respective file extent items are added to the
# snapshot's btree.

# on each filesystem) instead of the snapshot's received_uuid value (which is
# preserved across different filesystems).
