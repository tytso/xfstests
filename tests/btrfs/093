# FS QA Test No. btrfs/093
#
# Test btrfs file range cloning with the same file as a source and destination.
#
# This tests a specific scenario where the extent layout of the file confused
# the clone ioctl implementation making it return -EEXIST to userspace.
# This issue was fixed by the following linux kernel patch:
#
#    Btrfs: fix range cloning when same inode used as source and destination
#

_begin_fstest auto quick clone

# Import common functions.

# Create a file with an extent layout that confused the btrfs clone ioctl
# implementation. The first extent item that is cloned by the second call
# to the cloner program will have only a trailing part of it referenced by
# a new extent item, since the source offset starts in the middle of that
# extent. This confused the clone ioctl because after inserting this new
# extent item it would immediately after process it again thinking it
# corresponded to an extent that existed before - this made it attempt to
# insert a duplicated extent item pointing to the same extent again, which
# made it return an -EEXIST error to userspace and turn the filesystem to
# readonly mode (since the current transaction got aborted).
