# while file "src" has an inline extent which is 20 bytes long. The clone
# operation would remove the inline extent of "src" and then copy the inline
# extent from "src.clone1" into "src", which means we would lose the last 10
# bytes of data from "src" (on read we would get 0x00 as the value for any
# of those 10 bytes, because the file's size remains as 20 bytes).
